  :arrow_forward: How to run
</h2>

### First steps

If you want to run the application in your computer, follow these steps;
First of all, you'll need to clone the repository and install the dependencies. Assuming you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed in your computer, follow the steps bellow:

```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/TiagoDiass/rocketshoes-zustand.git

# Enter the repo's folder
$ cd rocketshoes-zustand

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Start the application
$ yarn dev

# Start the fake server (you'll have to do that in another terminal tab or terminal itself)
$ yarn start:api
```

After following these steps, the terminal will show you in which port it's running, it's on the port 3000 usually, so, you'll just need to enter in your browser and
type `localhost:3000`, then you'll be able to check the app running. When you want to stop it, go to the terminal that you used to start the app, and type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>,
this way you'll stop the app

Hope you enjoyed this project :smiley:<br>
